<h3 class="chair">Google adds new items to its list of products.</h3>
<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/04/technology/google-pixel-event-chromecast-october/index.html"> <img class="img"src="http://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/18522-17518-googlepixel-inline-l.jpg"> Google releases new phone. 10/4/2016 </a>
<p class="para"> With the new release of Google's newest tech yesterday, 2016 will be the year of Virtual Reality among other things. Google revealed a fancy new phone called the Pixel and Pixel XL.
this phone is the first of its kind with Google Assistant built it. The features are amazing: 5.0" and 5.5" AMOLED; Gorilla glass; 12.3 and 8mp cameras. Storage capacity is a big thing in
the mobile business, the Pixel has a storage capacity of 32 or 128gb with place for microSD Card. It will be running the newst operating system by Google: the 7.1 Android Nougat. Available
in blue, silver, and black.</p>
<p class="para"> The Pixel has a large memory with 4gb of RAM, the processor is quad core 2.15GHz/1.6Ghz. The best feature among all of these great features is the capability to have unlimted photo 
and video storage. The body of the phone is a metal unibody made of alluminum. The Pixel is not the only thing Google released on October 4th 2016. They release the VR headset Daydream. Much 
like its compitetion it is used to play Virtual Reality games. You place your phone in the headset and place on your head; the future is here! Google had some more annoucements but the phone and headset were the biggest.</p>

<p class="para"> With more and more wars and disease spreading, and as time goes on; certain species are fastly approaching their end. This unfortunatly is the case for the Rabbs’ fringe-limbed tree frog as of 10/4/2016
The frog was the last of its kind and this is a reoccuring thing with many species; mostly reptiles and ampebians. The widespread of spraying chemicals, the long stretches of wars, the illegal burning 
of certain land is a big part of species going extinct. There are ways we can improve but we must come together as a planet and with conflicting intrests that will never happen. Just do your part and 
dont harm the environment.</p>

<p class="para">As a result of Hurricane Matthew 16 people have died and thousands evacuated to shelters with very limited water. We need to help them as they are in serious need of assistance, natural disasters are brutal.
The winds are around 100mph and will move from Haiti to Florida in the next week. In 2010 Haiti was hit with a very large and devestating earthquake, the country is at a hot spot for plate shifts under
the earths surface. Elections for both legislative and presidential leaders would be postponned due to the situation at large. Both the World Food Programme and Unicef have begun to reach out and help Haiti.
Alot of damage has been done as Hurricane Matthew is the worse Hurricane in decades for Haiti.</p>

<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-smartphones-idUSKCN12D363"> <img class="img"src="http://icdn9.digitaltrends.com/image/samsung-galaxy-note-7-widgets-2-1500x1000.jpg"> U.S. bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from air travel. 10/14/2016 </a>
<p class="para">Any people caught with the phone in the possesion or in the luggage will face confiscation as well as fines for disobeying orders. The U.S. Transportation Department and the TSA among others are implementing the new rule.
The risk of a fire or explosion is not worth it, many people could be hurt or killed if the worse comes to worse. While some arguements are valid stating that this inconvenices some guests; but those are soon defeated by the precautions
we must take for the safety of all passengers. Samsung will take a big hurt from the issues at hand but will bounce back surely. Samsung has received 96 reports of batteries catching fire.</p>

<p class="para">On October 14th Vice President Joe Biden told NBC's "Meet the Press" that the US is ready to strike with a vengence but just waiting for the perfect oppurtunity to do the most damage. Hillary Clintons emails are more and more coming 
to surface thanks to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks and Russia are in no way affiliated with each other, Russia gets the blame while WikiLeaks does the work. Accusations againts Russia have recently been more popular due to the fact that Russia is being
blamed for the new released emails that harm Clintons campaign. Russia has its own voice and thoughts but it knows when and when not to act, the U.S and and Russia are allies; it may seem the tension is getting bigger but we know it will dissolve.
BRICS and NATO are opposing forces in this world, but at the same time they are allies for world peace.</p>

<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/10/14/facebook-censors-nipples-but-not-live-video-man-committing-suicide.html"> <img class="img" src="http://www.chrisnewnham.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/facebookisthedevil2.png"> Facebook censors content, but not live suicide. 10/14/2016 </a>
<p class="para"> Two days ago in the country of Turkey, a man live streamed his own suicide for the world to view, it was shown on Facebook and was not censored one bit. Facebook is taking fire over this because they ban all photos or videos showing 
private parts,sexual activity, and drug use but they couldnt censor the graphic taking of ones life. The new live option on Facebook allows the viewers to watch the content in real time without the need for uploading and posting. We can 
only hope after this horrific event occured that Facebook is looking to have a solution to that one underlying problem. It will be difficult to censor in real time, but here in late 2016; I believe we can accomplish that simple task. We 
will wait and see what happens in the next weeks.</p>
