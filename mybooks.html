  <h4>Chapter 1</h4>
<p>
		 A strange smell filled the air, I was just finishing my last
cigarette as the clock strikes 7:00pm. The sun is down and Christmas is
in two days. I go inside my house after my cigarette to get my wallet and 
keys when my phone starts ringing. It was my wife Hollie. "Hey honey, i'll
be home late tonight there is alot of paperwork." she said. "Okay be careful 
and call me if you need to, I love you bye.". I hung up and walked out the
door, I needed to get a few items at the store but before I could start my 
car my boss Rudy texts me: "Trevor, turn on the news as soon as possible.".
I went back inside my house disregarding the store. I turn on the news and
see some crazy stuff. I called Robert and Tyler and told him to come over as
soon as possible. I started to get my computer out when Hollie, Tyler, Robert,
Sarah, and Amanda walk in. We all gather around the TV to hear the breaking 
news: "Around every state in the country and in numerous countries, there has
been an onslaught of giant animals killing people. Over 350 total deaths world-
wide that we know of. We will have more as the story progresses. Stay indoors.".
